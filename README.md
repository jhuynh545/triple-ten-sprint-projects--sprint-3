As an analyst for the telecom operator Megaline, your task is to determine which of the company's two prepaid plans—Surf or Ultimate—generates more revenue. This analysis will help the commercial department optimize the advertising budget.

The project involves analyzing a dataset of 500 clients, including their demographics, location, plan type, and usage data for calls, text messages, and web traffic during 2018. The revenue model for each plan incorporates base monthly charges and additional fees for exceeding the included minutes, messages, or data allowances.

Plan details:

Surf: $20/month; includes 500 minutes, 50 texts, 15 GB. Overages: 3 cents/min, 3 cents/text, $10/GB.
Ultimate: $70/month; includes 3000 minutes, 1000 texts, 30 GB. Overages: 1 cent/min, 1 cent/text, $7/GB.
You will analyze client behavior, calculate revenue for each plan, and provide insights to guide advertising budget decisions.
